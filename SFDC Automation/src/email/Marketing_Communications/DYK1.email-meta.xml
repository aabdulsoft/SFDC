Chatter Groups provide users the ability to communicate information to an entire population of users (Public), or direct the information to a specific group of users (Private). Any user can join a public group, but must request and receive access permission to join private groups. To create a group, simply click on the Chatter or Group headers from your home page, select &quot;Groups &quot;, and then add yourself to a group or create a new group. If you&apos;re creating a new group, create your group&apos;s name and provide a brief description of the group&apos;s purpose. Indicate whether the group is public or private. Once you&apos;ve created your group, you can add members by selecting &quot;add group members&quot; as well as set up group email alerts. It&apos;s that simple.</textOnly>
